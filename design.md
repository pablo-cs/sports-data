Plan what you are going to build with your group. Remember you should:
- Use full stack development skills
- Build something useful and usable
- Get frequent feedback and iterate on your project


You are encouraged to:
- Create at least 3 modules – you have 3 people and plenty of time so this shouldn’t be hard
    - For the api itself
    - Layout stuff
    - Routes
    - Helpers
    - Main
- Process some data – could be from API, audio, images, video, etc.
- Have a thoughtful testing plan and tests


Create a project plan that includes:
- Name of Project
    - Sports Player Data and Event Finder
- What problem are you solving?
    - Making athlete data and events more user-friendly and accessible
- Who / What does the project interface with?
    - Sports fans
    - NBA API (or any other sports API)
    - Ticketmaster API
    - A SQL Database
- What are the inputs?
    - User searches for players, games, teams
        - User specifies what they are searching
- What are the outputs?
    - Webpages with data and coverage of various athletes, teams, games, etc.
- List 5 steps to go from input -> output
- What’s the biggest risk?
    - Not having up to date or limited data
- How will you know you’re successful?
    - When users are able to easily access and interpret the information about various NBA players


Create a mock-up (you can use wireframe.cc or Figma) remembering basic design principles:
- Jakobs Law: Users spend most of their time on other sites. This means that users prefer your site to work the same way as all the other sites they already know. Design for patterns for which users are accustomed.
- Fitt’s Law: The time to acquire a target is a function of the distance to and size of the target.
- F pattern: User fixations are concentrated at the top and the left side of the page


Decide which Kanban tool you will use:
- Setup the tool - make sure everyone has access and it has the appropriate “swim lanes” or columns
- Backlog
- Ready / Current Sprint
- In Progress
- Done


Put tasks into the tool's backlog to prepare for your sprint planning meeting


Agree on a definition of "done":
- Does the code follow style conventions?
- Does the code have corresponding tests that pass?
- Does the code pass existing CI tests?
- Does the code have comments?


Schedule your first sprint meetings:
- Sprint planning
- Stand up meeting
- Sprint review – make sure to invite someone (an instructor or TA) to give you feedback
- Sprint retrospective
